1. Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using a machine learning model. It uses passenger data like ticket class and gender to train a Logistic Regression classifier to determine if a passenger survived the disaster.

Dataset üìä
This project uses the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers. The model is built using the following features:

Pclass: The passenger's ticket class (1, 2, or 3).

Sex: The passenger's gender (male or female).

The target variable to be predicted is:

Survived: A binary value indicating survival (1 for Survived, 0 for Not Survived).

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset (tested.csv) is loaded, and an initial analysis is performed to understand its structure.

Data Visualization: Relationships between features like Pclass and Sex versus the Survived outcome are visualized using seaborn.

Data Preprocessing:

The categorical Sex column is converted to numerical values (male: 1, female: 0) using LabelEncoder.

Missing values are addressed by dropping the Age column, which contained many null entries.

Model Training:

Features (X) are selected (Pclass, Sex).

The target (Y) is set to the Survived column.

The data is split into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set and on new, unseen data.

üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Required
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION (1).ipynb in your preferred environment (like Jupyter Lab or VS Code). Execute the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.

‚úÖ Results
The model is trained to predict whether a passenger survived. The final section of the notebook allows you to input a passenger's class and sex to receive a prediction.

For example, to predict the survival of a male passenger in 2nd class:

Python

# The input [2, 1] represents Pclass=2 and Sex=1 (male)
res = log.predict([[2, 1]])

if(res == 0):
  print("So Sorry! Not Survived")
else:
  print("Survived")
2. Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data üìà
This project analyzes an advertising dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts sales based on the amount of money spent on different advertising platforms. A Simple Linear Regression model is implemented to understand the relationship between TV advertising expenditure and sales.

üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes the Advertising dataset (advertising.csv), which contains data on advertising spending and corresponding sales.

The features in the dataset are:

TV: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars).

Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars).

Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars).

The target variable is:

Sales: Product sales (in thousands of units).

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
The project follows these key steps:

Data Loading & Exploration: The advertising.csv dataset is loaded using pandas. Initial exploration is performed to check its shape, and descriptive statistics.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A pairplot and histograms are created to visualize the relationships between advertising channels and sales.

A correlation heatmap is generated, which reveals a strong positive correlation (0.9) between TV advertising and Sales, making it the best predictor for a simple linear model.

Model Training:

The dataset is split into features (X) and the target variable (y). For this simple regression model, 'TV' is chosen as the sole feature.

The data is divided into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%).

A Simple Linear Regression model from scikit-learn is trained on the training data.

Evaluation & Prediction:

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.

The model's coefficient and intercept are extracted to form the linear regression equation.

A scatter plot of the test data is created with the regression line overlaid to visually assess the model's performance.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

üöÄ Setup and Usage
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

Bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook sales_prediction.ipynb in your preferred environment. Execute the cells to see the complete analysis, model training, and results.

‚úÖ Results
The Linear Regression model successfully captures the relationship between TV advertising and sales. The final model can be represented by the equation:

Sales ‚âà 7.14 + 0.055 * TV

This equation indicates that for every additional $1000 spent on TV advertising, sales are predicted to increase by approximately 55 units. The final visualization shows the regression line fitting well with the test data, confirming the model's predictive capability.

3. Iris Flower Classification Using K-Means Clustering üå∏
This project demonstrates how to classify the Iris flower dataset using the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique. The goal is to group the flowers into three distinct clusters corresponding to the three species of Iris (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, loaded directly from the Seaborn library. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers.

The features in the dataset are:

sepal_length: Length of the sepal in cm.

sepal_width: Width of the sepal in cm.

petal_length: Length of the petal in cm.

petal_width: Width of the petal in cm.

The target variable is:

species: The species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The project follows these steps:

Data Loading & Preprocessing:

The Iris dataset is loaded using Seaborn.

The categorical species column is converted to numerical labels (0 for Setosa, 1 for Versicolor, 2 for Virginica).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

3D and 2D scatter plots are created to visualize the natural clustering of the data based on petal and sepal dimensions.

Determining Optimal Clusters (Elbow Method):

The K-Means algorithm is run for a range of k values (1 to 9).

The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is plotted against k. The "elbow" of the plot at k=3 indicates the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means Model Training:

The K-Means model is trained with n_clusters=3 on the petal_length and petal_width features.

Model Evaluation:

A confusion matrix is created to compare the true species labels with the cluster labels assigned by the model, showing high accuracy.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries Used

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

üöÄ Setup and Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook iris_flower_classification (1).ipynb in your preferred environment. Execute the cells to see the complete analysis and results.

‚úÖ Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully grouped the Iris flowers into three distinct clusters with high accuracy. The confusion matrix shows:

Setosa: 50/50 samples were correctly clustered.

Versicolor: 48/50 samples were correctly clustered.

Virginica: 46/50 samples were correctly clustered.

This demonstrates that petal_length and petal_width are strong indicators for classifying the Iris species, even with an unsupervised learning approach.

4. Movie Rating Prediction üé¨
This project builds a model to predict movie ratings. It uses a dataset containing information about movies, users, and their corresponding ratings. The goal is to train a classification model to predict the rating a user might give to a movie.

üíæ Dataset
The project utilizes three datasets that are combined to create the final training data:

Movie Data (Movie_preprocessed.csv): Contains MovieID, MovieName, and Genre.

Ratings Data (ratings_preprocessed.csv): Contains UserID, MovieID, Ratings, and Timestamp.

User Data (users_preprocessed.csv): Contains UserID, Gender, Age, Occupation, and Zip-code.

The final model uses the following features for prediction:

UserID, MovieID, Gender, Age

The target variable is:

Ratings: The rating given by a user to a movie (on a scale of 1-5).

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
The project follows these key steps:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: The three datasets (movies, ratings, and users) are loaded. The Gender column is encoded into numerical values.

Data Combination: The individual dataframes are concatenated into a single dataframe for analysis.

Feature Selection: Unnecessary columns like Timestamp, Occupation, Zip-code, and text-based columns are dropped. The remaining features and the Ratings target are selected.

Model Training:

The data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

A Logistic Regression model is trained to classify movie ratings, treating the rating prediction as a multi-class classification problem.

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.
